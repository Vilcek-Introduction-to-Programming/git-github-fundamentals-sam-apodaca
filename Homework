I think the introduction to GitHub overall was very helpful. I've used the site a little in the past, but it was mostly just a way for me to download other people's code or to keep track of projects that I frequently used. While I did know that there were many collaborative aspects to github, I had never needed to use them myself, so I found those sections most informative. I definitely think that taking advantage of things like branches and pull requests could be very helpful for future coding projects. I don't think there are things that I am necessarily confused about, but I do think it could just take some time and practice to get used to the workflow.

In regard to Wilson et al., I think one of the biggest ways that GitHub can help is with keeping track of changes. Being able to back up everything related to a project in one location with notes containing information about every change that is made helps a lot with the practices listed. The cloud aspect of GitHub also makes it easy for everyone involved in the project to quickly share any changes.
